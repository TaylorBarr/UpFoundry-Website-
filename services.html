								<h5>The Financial Upside Principle we follow...</h5>
								<p>It might be advantageous for us to take on any client that comes to us wanting our help. Not necessarily. We work off the Financial Upside Principle: If The Up Foundry can't positively conclude we will provide &nbsp;ROI from the investment you make in us, we won't take on the client. If we concluded this after we start working with you and you are not satisfied -<b> full 60 days money back guaranteed</b>. No harm, no foul. No questions asked.&nbsp;</p>

							<h1>Questions that might be holding you back.....</h1>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-4">
							<h6>I only have a few affiliate program management needs - I don't need the whole train + cabose. Do you offer individual services?</h6>
							<p>Absolutely - if you already have an affiliate program or just need a few hands to get started internally with your affiliate program, we can help. Fill out our form and let us know what you need and we can discuss this in the honesty session.&nbsp; </p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="col-sm-4">
							<h6>Are your services expensive?&nbsp;</h6>
							<p>Before I answer honestly - please refer to the Financial Upside Principal above about your investment in us. tldr; If we don't think we can confidently provide you a return on our services, we won't be a good fit for you (and we tell you this before going down that road). With that said -the overall cost can depend on what you need. For example, if you need full affiliate program launch, affiliate support, monitoring and reporting that is going to cost signifcantly more than if you just have a few questions and need a push to get going. &nbsp;We tell it straight before the work begins.&nbsp;<br><br>We can say is: We offer a very specialized service that would take hiring an employee internally - years to get up and running. We have 10 years experience working within technology companies (from startups to public companies), so we onboard quickly to your process much faster than say a Marketing Manager.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="col-sm-4">
							<h6>Do you require long-term contracts?</h6>
							<p>If you select any of our one-off services (like help in launching your program but not managing it)-- we don't require long term contracts.<br><br>For ongoing services, we require 6 month contract with a small upfront cost (% of monthly cost) &nbsp;to get started. Why? If you are a new program or even existing program, depending on the situation we walk into, it takes some time to get affiliates promoting and process to be in full swing. This gives us the appropriate time to give you the results your expecting.&nbsp;</p>
						</div>
					</div><div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-4">
							<h6>Do you offer a money back gurrantee if I am not happy with your services?</h6>
							<p>We hope it doesn't come to that and we will do everything in our power to correct it based on your situation. If after that our efforts fail you, we will offer a 60 day money back guranteee. No hassles. No annoying, "what did we do wrong?" surveys.&nbsp;</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="col-sm-4">
							<h6>This all sounds good -- but what if my affiliate program, after enlisting your help, doesn't make the company money ?</h6>
							<p>We recognize every business is different - and our services ARE NOT for every business out there. We can't promise or gurantee 100% on all services we offer, that we can make you big bucks. Personally, if another Affiliate management Services offers that - we think you should run.&nbsp;<br><br><b>If you should choose us, we will show you how to arm your affiliate program for success. </b>When it comes down to it, The affiliate channel is just a sub-sect of your overall marketing channel. If you are having issues acquiring customers due to your &nbsp;product or service, this can affect your affiliate channel.&nbsp;</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="col-sm-4">
							<h6>You haven't sold me. Aren't Affiliate Marketers just dark knights of the marketing world?</h6>
							<p>It's fair people have this opinion about affiliate marketers probably due to the rise of affiliate fraud and black hat tactics in the media as of the past 5 years. Unfortanately, the good stuff never makes the news:)<br><br>With any industry - there are good apples and bad apples. &nbsp;There is a remarkable amount of bad affiliates out there that ruin it for the good ones.<br><br>Our goal is to introduce your affiliate program to the good ones that could be real assets to your company and keep out the bad ones. Simple as that. &nbsp;</p>
