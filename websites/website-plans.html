							<div class="faq">
								<h5>What if I am interested in the plan but don't know if something is covered?</h5>
								<p>
									No, problem. <a href="mailto:taylor@upfoundry.com">Email me here</a> and I can let you know prior to signing up.</p>
							</div>
					
							<div class="faq">
								<h5>What is the goal of office hours? &nbsp;</h5>
								<p>For non-Monthly Website Clients, I estimate the work, have them approve and I answer any questions via email, and then I complete the work on their website. For Monthly Website clients that need a helping hand each month, You get a face-to-face discussion or Skype call, to allow you to really get the attention you need on what needs to be done with your site. Overall, it is a more hands-on approach and allows you to describe EXACTLY what you need.</p>
							</div>
					
							<div class="faq">
								<h5>Can you explain the 10% discount on estimates?</h5>
								<p>If you need something new that is not included as an eligible task under the Monthly Website Plan, as a Plan Holder - you would get 10% off on the estimate of what I normally charge non-monthly website plan holders. <br><br>For example, if you came to me requesting a project for me to build say a new"mini" site for a new product or service you are offering and I estimated that would cost, hypothetically, $1000.00 - you, as a Monthly Website Plan holder would get a 10% discount: and the work would only be $900.00 (versus $1K for everyone else who is not a Monthly Website Plan Holder.)<br><br>It's a benefit for you if you know you will need me to create some big projects for you in the future.&nbsp;</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					
						<div class="col-sm-6">
							<div class="faq">
								<h5>Is there a limit to the amount of tasks I can request per month?</h5>
								<p>Yes - to make this cost effective for the both of us, I'd like to keep the requests at 4 per month. What constitutes a task or how do you know the limit? Here are examples:<br><br><b>Acceptable example for what constitutes as one task:</b> <span><i>"Change the text color for all paragraphs on my site to blue."</i><br><br>The task doesn't have to be isolated to one area of the site, it's based on the theme so to speak (the theme in the example above would be: <i>color change.) </i><br></span></p>
							</div>
					
							<div class="faq">
								<h5>Do my tasks carry over if I don't request any in a given month. </h5>
								<p>Unfortunately, they do not. Since I work on your account each month (backups, review, and training), the plan price compensates for those activities.&nbsp;</p>
							</div><div class="faq">
								<h5>What is involved in Training + Support?&nbsp;</h5>
								<p>Beyond doing the work for your website, I like to teach others what they are interested in - around their website. If it has to do with the inter-workings of the website - awesome! If it something around, "How can I grow my website to attract more clients?" I also have experience in that as well. It's want you want it to be:)<br><br></p>
